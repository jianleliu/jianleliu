## My experience with js and ui
<img width="200px" class="rounded float-start pe-4" src="../img/js_wod/sprite.gif">
  My first experience with JS was back in high school, working with sprites and event handlers/listeners. I didn’t think much about it and did all that tedious work. I thought that was all to game development, and it was when I started hating web ui design because of how time-consuming it was. Later, when I learned html and css, I hated web design and front end work even more. Like, just imagine, building a website with only html, css, and javascript. It was a nightmare, even more so for a newbie programmer at the time. Since then, I’ve put my eyes and career set on other fields of the cs industry.  

My recent experience with web development didn’t start with an intention to build a nice-looking website, but to visually display the results of my future projects/scripts – a web platform. I coded my first project with an intention to combine what I learned in my database class with python. Then, I got an impulse to build a fullstack project because “why not”. I did my project and got everything to work without putting much effort into ui design other than the navbar. It took me a good amount of tedious work to get the navbar to be "decent-looking" Then, I discovered bootstrap. I was both amazed by how simple and beautiful it works out, at the same time, I felt stupid by not discovering it earlier.

## When compared to other programming languages

My honest thoughts about js are, “It’s used for web scripting,” “convenience to write scripts for a responsive website,” “web specialized programming language.” When compared to other programming languages, 
  js is better than java in a sense that it’s easier to understand and can accomplish many things that can’t be done in java, such as pass function as parameter, functions can return more than one data type, and is convenience for the consumer side because all modern browser comes with js.
  However, I consider this a web specialized programming language because it’s not as versatile as other languages such as java, C, C++, or python. JS has numerous third-party libraries supporting web development and to run scripts in the client side because they might not have a programming language compiler installed, but they definitely have js embedded in their browser.

## Effective learning method

WOD, Workout of the Day, is the perfect style of solving programming challenges. I personally think there are two aspects of the WOD made this style an excellent learning method, ‘score’ and ‘open-internet’. The ‘score’ is the amount of time a student took to finish the challenge, and it consists of 4 levels(time intervals): Rx, Av, Sd, and DNF.
  Once the student’s timer reaches DNF, the student will have to look up the answer and redo the problem until the student solves the problem within a certain amount of time. These two mechanisms represent engagement, repetition, and time efficiency, which are crucial for learning. To me, this will definitely work.
