## Introduction
AI is a convenience tool, and merely a tool to perform tasks with increased efficiency. In the field of SWE, where there are countless numbers of frameworks and libraries out there, it is certainly impossible for an engineer to learn and master them all. Every SWE in the field knows that when a software application has gone wrong, and the person doesn't know how to solve it, that person either asks for help, google it, scroll through long lists of documentation, or wait an unproductive amount of time for a stack overflow response. AI, in another sense, and what I viewed it, is simply an efficient library with a better search feature, but, since it is merely a library, I would still have to learn the fundamental and essential concepts as an engineer and not a bookworm. 

## My Experience With ChatGPT

I generally view learning with two categories, essential and nonessential. For example, a school teacher allows kids to use a calculator after they have mastered the 4 fundamental math operators. This goes the same for me, and for the majority of the people and programmers, because why code from scratch when there is a working template somewhere online? And just like the kids and programmers in the scenarios above, I wouldn’t use the calculator(AI) before mastering what I think is essential. 

This is also my stance on the leetcode-like WOD(workout of the day). I viewed them as a learning opportunity and essential for an engineer. I would ask AI with questions like “write me some examples using this method from the … library.” but never a question like “give me the answer.” I did, however, ask “how do I do xyz” when I tried and could’t find a way to work around something or when I’m designing my personal project and needed to find frameworks to code each of the microservices. For example, “what do I use to extract mp3 files from youtube?”. And this saved me so much time without needing to go through forums and/or reading documentations.

Other cases I would use AI frequently is when I don’t understand a chunk of code. I would usually ask “explain this to me {paste codes}”, which I think it did really well, better than stackoverflow, majority of the time at easing my confusion. Other times I use AI is when I’m debugging something. I would simply send “{my code} {output} what is wrong?” and it is pretty keen most of the time at spotting my errors, but sometimes it adds confusion and more work. There is also a problem of over relying on using AI, despite the fact that I'm refraining myself from doing so most of the time, which is a disadvantage but this is probably the same as googling for the answer. 

Recently, I’m working on a full stack group project where I’m responsible for the backend and server maintenance, I’ve asked AI about how things works and learned a bunch of them such as how mongo, nosql, nonrelational, database work and the commands/functions for mongodb operations. AI has been helpful in helping me understand through listing examples with explanations, and in my opinion, it has done a much better job than the official documentation in helping me understand how a framework works.

I also frequently use AI for writing my essays for all of my courses. This is like a calculator example at the start, I can write essays but it takes much more time. So usually I would simply write the outline and send it to ChatGPT to output a text with a specific word count. Then I would edit the parts I deem unnecessary before finalizing it. I would then use AI for grammar and word choice checks simply because AI is much more helpful in grammar checking than using some writing grammar check algorithm.


## Conclusion

In conclusion, AI is nothing more than a tool. It functions as a tool to increase efficiency of doing certain tasks. For SWE, AI can save much more time that otherwise would be spent browsing the internet and reading long documentations. It performs better than humans in validating codes in some scenarios. AI is a tool that every SWE should use regardless of experience since it benefits learning a concept much faster for juniors and saves time for seniors by working like an advanced internet library and can also generate templates for a project/program.
