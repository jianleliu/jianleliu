On occasion, I need to retrieve numerous images from the internet. However, I encountered a challenge when I couldn't locate a .avif image reader for Windows. Consequently, I took it upon myself to create a script that converts all the .avif images into .png format. This ensure the image quality remained intact during the conversion process, and made my life much more convenient.
