<div class="text-center p-4">
  <img width="300px" src="../img/meme_generator/display_page.png" >

This program was created to help myself better understand about API and the python library called "Requests", as well as a practical programming experience. This project also helped me understand about dynamic and static pagination and the solution to them.
